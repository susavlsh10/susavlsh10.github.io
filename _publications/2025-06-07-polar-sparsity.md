Polar Sparsity is a new approach to structured sparsity in deep neural networks. By leveraging polar coordinate transformations, this method enables more efficient pruning and compression of model parameters while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and model performance compared to traditional sparsity techniques.
