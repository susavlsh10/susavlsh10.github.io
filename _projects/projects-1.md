**Problem:** Large language models require huge memory for multi-vector retrieval. 

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, CUDA, SSDs

**My Role:** Led SSD-based embedding offload, designed software prefetcher, and optimized retrieval pipeline.

**Outcome:** Achieved 16x memory reduction and 6.4x faster retrieval. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05417) | [Code](https://github.com/susavlsh10/espn)
