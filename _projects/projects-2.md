**Problem:** Deep neural networks are often too large for efficient deployment on edge devices.

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy

**My Role:** Developed the polar sparsity algorithm, implemented model pruning, and led experimental validation.

**Outcome:** Achieved significant model compression with minimal accuracy loss. [Paper](#)
