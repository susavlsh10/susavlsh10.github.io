* Led efforts to develop more efficient systems for deep learning applications; Neural Information Retrieval (IR).
* Trained a BERT based model for IR using pytorch and knowledge distillation with Recall@1K of 96%.
* Developed a novel embedding processing system with Nvidia GDS & custom CUDA kernels achieving 23% speedup.
* Designed a flexible software prefetcher for Neural IR systems achieving hit rates exceeding 90%, allowing embeddings to be retrieved from storage with near memory latency with 16x less memory footprint.

* Developed a novel IR embedding retrieval and processing architecture, leveraging SmartSSD with custom similarity computation kernels (FPGA) to offload similarity processing close to storage.  
* Reduced CPU workload by 4x, reduced memory usage by 82% without degrading retrieval quality of the IR model.  
* Accelerated neural inference by 64% by compressing the model with knowledge distillation, pruning and quantization.  
* Delivered 2 patents applications for efficient Neural Information Retrieval system design during the internship.
