Work experience
======


**Texas A&M University**   
&nbsp; **Graduate Research Assistant**  
* Led efforts to create more efficient systems for deep learning applications; Neural Information Retrieval (IR).
* Trained a BERT based model for IR using pytorch and knowledge distillation with Recall@1K of 96%.
* Developed a novel embedding processing system with Nvidia GDS & custom CUDA kernels achieving 23% speedup.
* Designed a flexible software prefetcher for Neural IR systems achieving hit rates exceeding 90%, allowing 
embeddings to be retrieved from storage with near memory latency with 16x less memory footprint.
