## Introduction
<!-- Computer Engineering | PhD candidate @ TAMU -->

<!-- I specialize in building efficient and scalable machine learning systems for real-world deployment. My research focuses on accelerating large-scale inference through hardware-aware design, sparsity, and parallelism. I am advised by [Dr. Narasimha Annapareddy](https://experts.tamu.edu/expert/narasimha-annapareddy/). -->

I specialize in building **efficient and scalable machine learning systems** for real-world deployment. My work bridges the gap between algorithm design and system-level efficiency, with a focus on **accelerating large-scale inference** through **hardware-aware design**, **sparsity**, and **parallelism**.

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at **Texas A&M University**, advised by [Dr. Narasimha Annapareddy](https://experts.tamu.edu/expert/narasimha-annapareddy/).
