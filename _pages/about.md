Computer Engineering | PhD candidate @ TAMU
-------------------

Working on democratizing deep learning and AI by building hardware efficient and scalable systems. 

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University being advised by [Dr. Narasimha Annapareddy](https://experts.tamu.edu/expert/narasimha-annapareddy/). I'm interested in efficient Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Parallel, Distributed Computing and building hardware efficient systems.
